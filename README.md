# The application

This is an application designed to provide detailed information about the accessibility of various places. The goal of this app is to help users, especially those with in wheelchair to easily find accessible locations and services.

## How to run

Because the app uses Google Maps API, it cannot be simply cloned and run locally without the API key which is not in the repository. If you want to test the app, you can join as a tester via Firebase. Please reach out to me at [aaro.koinsaari@proton.me](mailto:aaro.koinsaari@proton.me).

## Contributing

Contributions to this project are welcome! If you're interested in improving the app, fixing bugs, or adding new features, feel free to open a pull request or an issue. You can also contact me at [aaro.koinsaari@proton.me](mailto:aaro.koinsaari@proton.me), because the Maps API key would be needed for testing purposes.
